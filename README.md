# Algorithms and Data Structures (ads)
Various Algorithms and Data Structures written in C11.

I make no guarantee that any of these ADS are safe to use in production code. NULL checks are certainly missing (or intentionally not included), and various warnings are emitted (usually implicit pointer conversions). However, these should be "good enough" for hobby projects or as a learning foundation.
